Hello DoC'ers and welcome to 2015! Before we get on to all the exciting events we're planning for this term, it's worth taking a look back at one of our busiest terms to date!

Hoodies
=======
Our hoodie shipment arrived and we've united 80 wonderful students each with a beautiful DoCSoc hoodie! We've subsidised the hoodies 25% off cost price each to ensure everyone who wants one, gets one.

Freshers Fair
=============
At the start of the year, DoCSoc - along with over 300 other Imperial societies - took part in the Freshers Fair. We grabbed our banner  making sure we were known to all the new Computing and JMC first years! We ran a speed-typing challenge using a blank keyboard and the winner scored a massive 154 words-per-minute!

Amazon Office Trip
==================
75 of us piled on to the Tube straight after lectures to make the short trek to Barbican to visit Amazon on their gorgeous home turf! [Amazon](http://amazon.com) were wonderful hosts, providing drinks and pizza; and even flew down some of their engineers from Edinburgh to meet us!

Interstellar IMAX Trip
========================
My favourite movie of 2014! At Imperial College we have the wonderful privelage of counting The Science Museum amongst our neighbours. When we heard the were showing Interstellar in true IMAX. DoCSoc subsidised the tickets to half price. After we ran out of our initial batch within two hours, we purchased a much larger batch which ran out in just two hours!

End of Term Bar Night
=====================
To celebrate the end of exams and coursework - DoCSoc sponsored free food and drinks at Eastside Bar! We quickly found ourselves running out of food so did the only respectable thing and doubled our order!

One more thing...
