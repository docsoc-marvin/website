IC Hack is back! Running for its sixth consecutive year, we’re inviting 300 of the UK’s most creative and talented students to London to hack on any project that takes their fancy for 24 hours.

Programming and design come together to build the technology of the future. 

This year, IC Hack 17 will be hosted at Imperial College London's South Kensington campus!

Tickets will be available soon. Register your interest at ichack.org!
