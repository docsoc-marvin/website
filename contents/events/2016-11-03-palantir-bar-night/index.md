It's time for DoCSoc's second bar night of the year! This time, we're kindly supported by our sponsor Palantir.

Whether you went to our first bar night or not, this bar night is going to be a big one so come along! Note that this time we are in Metric and not the Union Bar (the nightclub on opposite side of the building)!

Drinks tokens will be given upon entry for FREE to any member of the Department of Computing. Tokens are valid for both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.

NOTE: This event follows the "Think Like A Palantir Engineer" event. You can, and are encouraged, to go to both!

Strictly DoCSoc members only - we will be checking everyone. If you study Computing/JMC, you are already a member of DoCSoc. No tickets are available on the door, you have until 6:30pm on the day to buy membership.
