As winter approaches, it's time for the first London Tech Societies Mixer of this year! And it's never been this big!

Following last year's success, Goldsmiths' Hacksmiths, KCL Tech, Imperial's DoCSoc, UCL's TechSoc and City's Tech Society will be having a mixer on the 21st November.

We look forward to seeing in you in Metric, Imperial College Union, at 7pm! Don't forget your student ID so that we can sign you in!

See you there!
