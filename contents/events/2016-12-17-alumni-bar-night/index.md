Get ready - It's time for the final bar night of 2016!

Come on down for another great evening at the Union Bar. This time, we'll also be welcoming back some of our alumni from back when DoCSoc bar nights used to cost money! It's bound to be a night to remember, and an awesome way to end the term.

Drinks tokens will be given upon entry for FREE to any member of the Department of Computing, or alumni from the Department.
