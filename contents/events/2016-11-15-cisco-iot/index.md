Join us for a talk about IoT from Andrea Ibiassi, a Virtual Systems Specialist at Cisco!

The Internet of Things is transforming businesses and industries. According to International Data Corporation (IDC), the IoT install base will grow to more than 25.6 billion endpoints by 2019. This will be equivalent to a $1.3 trillion market. The potential is huge. IoT is definitely a hot topic and everyone wants a slice of the cake.

During this talk, we will uncover Cisco’s role in IoT, what Cisco is currently doing in this space and how Cisco's IoT portfolio creates compelling solutions for Manufacturing, Oil & Gas, Utilities, Energy, Transportation, etc.
