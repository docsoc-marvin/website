  h1 Sponsorship
  p DoCSoc offers a lot to our students but this wouldn't be possible without the support we receive from industry.
  p In return, companies gain access to over 1000 active Computing, JMC and EIE students through a variety of events, sessions, emails, job advertisements and more.
  p We only hold events for speakers or companies who support us directly and we always welcome new partnerships and opportunities.
