  h1 Sponsorship
  p DoCSoc offers a lot to our students but this wouldn't be possible without the support we receive from industry.
  p In return, companies gain access to over 700 active computing students via a variety of events,  sessions, emails, job advertisements and more.
  p Whilst we do occasionally do one off non-career events for speakers or companies, preference is always given to those who support us directly and we always welcome new partnerships and opportunities.
  p.sponsor-attention DoCSoc has stopped accepting sponsors for this year!
  p If you would like to sponsor the society next year, please contact us when we begin considering new applications in July 2015.
